TODO

* Determine whether ebrowse.org is cruft.

* Determine whether anything useful is in c-ide-irony_bak.org.

* Take all code from the demo repository, incorporate it into the org
  files of this repository as babel-org source, from which to build
  the demo. That way the code will always be in sync with the
  snippets of the org files.
